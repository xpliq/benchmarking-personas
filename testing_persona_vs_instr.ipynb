    "# Testing Personified Prompts vs Instructional Prompts for LLMs\n",
    "- Personaified Prompts give a role to an LLM\n",
    "- Instructional Prompts give LLMs a task they follow throughout their response generation\n",
    "- Personas vs Instruction was motivated from how LLMs consider both when generating responses. Ultimately they follow a similar structure of having the Prompt (Persona or Inst.) as their system prompt throughout all response generation.\n",
    "- Because both are similar in execution, how different are the two in actual response quality.\n",
