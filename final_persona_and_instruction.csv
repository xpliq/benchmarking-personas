192,Q88,how deadly are brain tumors,Brain tumor,"A brain tumor, or tumour, is an intra cranial solid neoplasm , a tumor (defined as an abnormal growth of cells) within the brain or the central spinal canal ., Brain tumors include all tumors inside the cranium or in the central spinal canal., They are created by an abnormal and uncontrolled cell division , usually in the brain itself, but also in lymphatic tissue, in blood vessels , in the cranial nerves , in the brain envelopes ( meninges ), skull , pituitary gland, or pineal gland ., Within the brain itself, the involved cells may be neurons or glial cells (which include astrocytes , oligodendrocytes , and ependymal cells )., Brain tumors may also spread from cancers primarily located in other organs ( metastatic tumors )., Any brain tumor is inherently serious and life-threatening because of its invasive and infiltrative character in the limited space of the intracranial cavity., However, brain tumors (even malignant ones) are not invariably fatal, especially lipomas which are inherently benign., Brain tumors or intracranial neoplasms can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous ( benign ); however, the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differs from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non-cancerous neoplasms in the body., Its threat level depends on the combination of factors like the type of tumor, its location, its size and its state of development., Because the brain is well protected by the skull, the early detection of a brain tumor occurs only when diagnostic tools are directed at the intracranial cavity., Usually detection occurs in advanced stages when the presence of the tumor has caused unexplained symptoms., Primary (true) brain tumors are commonly located in the posterior cranial fossa in children and in the anterior two-thirds of the cerebral hemispheres in adults , although they can affect any part of the brain .",0,You are an expert in oncology with a specialization in neuro-oncology.,You must be able to provide an overview of the mortality rates associated with different types of brain tumors.,"The outcomes of brain tumors vary considerably based on the type of tumor, its location, grade, and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Malignant glioblastomas usually have very poor outcomes, while benign meningiomas typically have better outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for all malignant brain cancers in the United States is 33%. Secondary, or metastatic, brain tumors are more common and often have a worse prognosis than primary brain tumors. Prognosis is also influenced by age, functional status, genetic mutations, and specific tumor characteristics.","Brain tumors can vary significantly in terms of their lethality, depending on their type and severity. Malignant brain tumors, such as glioblastomas, typically have very poor outcomes with a median survival of around 15 months even with aggressive treatment. On the other hand, benign brain tumors, like meningiomas, usually have better outcomes. The overall five-year survival rate for all malignant brain tumors in the United States is 33%.

Breeding too early can have negative effects on the health of the mother and the puppies.","A female dog in heat, typically between 8 and 18 months old, reaches sexual maturity and can reproduce. During the reproductive cycle, which includes proestrus and estrus stages, the female becomes receptive to copulation.
